MetPlus DB

Description:
---------------------
MetPlus DB as a standalone SQLite database is developed to facilitate external identifier or mass-based searches from the collection of comprehensive metabolite databases. The data is primarily integrated by merging records based on IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChIKey) to deliver high confidence annotations with a significantly reduced redundancy and eliminates the complexity of extracting metabolite annotations from individual databases.

Disclaimer:
---------------------
MetPlus DB is a freely accessible SQLite database that assembles information from 3rd party data sources. We cannot guarantee that the database is error-free. Please feel free to report an error or send comments/suggestions to corresponding author by e-mail. We shall not be held liable for any inaccuracies and/or misuse of the information provided. Database updates take place every quarterly to broaden the search space and accommodate additional data-fields to serve the scientific community with the most up-to-date and comprehensive information on metabolites.
