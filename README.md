MetPlus DB

Description:
---------------------
MetPlus DB as a standalone SQLite database is developed to facilitate external identifier or mass-based searches from the collection of comprehensive metabolite databases. The data is primarily integrated by merging records based on IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChIKey) to deliver high confidence annotations with a significantly reduced redundancy and eliminates the complexity of extracting metabolite annotations from individual databases.
